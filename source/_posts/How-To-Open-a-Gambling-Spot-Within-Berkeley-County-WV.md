#  The Process of Opening a Gambling Spot in Berkeley County WV

The process of opening a gambling spot in Berkeley County WV is not as simple as one would think. There are many hoops to jump through and red tape to cut through. The first step is to find a location that is zoned for gambling. This can be a tricky proposition, as most of the county is zoned for agricultural or residential use.

Once a location has been found, the applicant must file an application with the West Virginia Racing Commission. This application must include detailed information about the proposed casino, including its layout, gaming machines, and food and beverage offerings.
