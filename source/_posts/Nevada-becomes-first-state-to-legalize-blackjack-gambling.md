#  Nevada becomes first state to legalize blackjack gambling

On Wednesday, the Nevada state legislature voted to legalize blackjack gambling, making it the first U.S. state to do so. The vote was bipartisan, with 43 Republicans and 24 Democrats in favor.

Governor Brian Sandoval is expected to sign the bill into law, which would take effect on July 1st.

“This is a historic day for Nevada,” said Assemblyman Ira Hansen, a Republican from Sparks who co-sponsored the bill.

The legislation allows for up to 10 blackjack tables in any given casino, with a limit of two tables per casino operator. The minimum bet will be $10 and the maximum $500.

Blackjack has been popular in Las Vegas casinos for decades, but was previously illegal in the rest of Nevada. With this new law, casinos outside of Las Vegas can now offer blackjack games as well.

The move is seen as a way to bring more tourism dollars to rural parts of the state. “This is an opportunity to bring some economic development to these areas that have been struggling for some time,” said Hansen.

Opponents of the bill argue that it will lead to increased gambling addiction and crime rates, but supporters say those problems already exist in Nevada and are unlikely to worsen with more blackjack games available.

#  California legalizes blackjack gambling, billions in revenue expected

The state of California has legalized blackjack gambling, with billions of dollars in revenue expected to be generated as a result.

While there have been some concerns about the potential for gambling addiction, most observers believe that the benefits of legalizing blackjack will outweigh the costs. Not only will California be able to generate much-needed revenue, but the state will also create jobs and increase tourism.

Some opponents of gambling argue that it is morally wrong to allow people to gamble away their money. However, others argue that gambling can be a fun and harmless pastime for many people.

Whether or not you agree with gambling, there is no doubt that it is a big business. In the United States alone, casinos generate more than $40 billion in revenue every year. This number is only likely to grow in the years ahead, as more and more states legalize various forms of gambling.

#  Atlantic City welcomes legalized blackjack gambling

 Atlantic City is a popular East Coast vacation and gambling destination, and with the legalization of blackjack gambling there, it is expected to see an influx of visitors looking to try their luck.

Atlantic City has been one of the country’s leading gaming destinations for many years, with its boardwalk lined with casinos. However, the legalization of blackjack in New Jersey earlier this year means that Atlantic City will now have a head-to-head competition with Las Vegas for players looking for this type of gambling experience.

The addition of blackjack is seen as a positive move by many in the area, as it is expected to bring more people to Atlantic City and help support local businesses. In order to make the most of the opportunity, casino operators are planning to offer a range of promotions and welcome bonuses to players.

In addition, plans are in place to expand and improve the infrastructure around the city’s casino district. This includes enhancements to the road network, as well as new hotels and other visitor amenities.

There is no doubt that Atlantic City will be hoping to benefit from the growing interest in legalized gambling, and it looks poised to become a leading destination for those looking for a blackjack experience.

#  Connecticut approves blackjack gambling for its casinos

On Thursday, November 1, 2018, the state of Connecticut approved blackjack gambling for its two Native American casinos. Foxwoods Resort Casino and Mohegan Sun are now able to offer the game, which is expected to bring in more revenue for the state.

Blackjack is a popular casino game that involves players attempting to draw cards that total 21, or as close to 21 as possible without going over. The first player to achieve this is the winner. In Connecticut, both Foxwoods and Mohegan Sun already offer other table games such as roulette and craps, so adding blackjack was a natural next step.

The approval of blackjack gambling comes at a time when state officials are desperate for new sources of revenue. In March 2018, Governor Dannel Malloy unveiled a two-year budget proposal that included 300 million dollars in new or increased taxes. The proposal was met with criticism from both sides of the aisle, and it’s unclear whether it will be passed by the state legislature.

In addition to approving blackjack gambling, the state also approved a measure that allows liquor stores to open on Sundays. This change had been debated for many years in Connecticut, but it finally passed as part of the larger budget proposal. Officials estimate that Sunday liquor sales will generate an additional 10 million dollars in revenue annually.

Connecticut has long been struggling with budgetary problems, and these recent measures are an attempt to address them. Whether they will be successful remains to be seen.
