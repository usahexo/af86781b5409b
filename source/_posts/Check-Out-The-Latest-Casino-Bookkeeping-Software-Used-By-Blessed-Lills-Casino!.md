#  An Overview Of The Casino Bookkeeping Software Used By Blessed Lills Casino

Blessed Lills Casino has been operational for over 5 years and during that time, they have used different casino bookkeeping software. In this article, we will take a look at the different software that has been used and what benefits each one has brought to the casino.

The first casino bookkeeping software used by Blessed Lills Casino was called “Casino Manager”. This software was created by a company called Gamblingsoft and it provided the casino with a number of features that were essential for running a successful operation. Some of these features included:

- tracking players’ activity
- managing payments and withdrawals
- issuing bonuses and promotions
- managing staff roles and responsibilities

The main benefit of using Casino Manager was that it was very easy to use and it allowed the casino to manage their finances effectively. However, since it was created over 10 years ago, it is no longer supported by Gamblingsoft and is no longer being developed. As a result, Blessed Lills Casino decided to switch to a new casino bookkeeping software in 2017.

The new casino bookkeeping software that was chosen is called “Casino Boss” and it was created by a company called Playtech. This software provides the casino with many features that are not available in Casino Manager, such as:

- advanced financial reports which provide deep insights into player behaviour and financial performance
- automated marketing tools which help to boost player engagement and increase profits
- support for multiple currencies and languages which makes it suitable for casinos with international players
