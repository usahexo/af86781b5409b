#  Casino Floors Paid Over $7 Million in Namibia!

The casino floors in Namibia paid over $7 million to the government in taxes for the year of 2016. This is according to a report that was released by the Minister of Finance and Economic Development, Calle Schlettwein.

The total amount of money that was collected from all of the casinos in the country amounted to $7,176,639. This is a slight increase from the taxes that were paid in 2015, which came out to $7,066,023.

The minister also noted that there was an increase in revenue generated by the casinos, as well as a growth in employment opportunities. He added that the government will continue to work with the private sector to create more jobs and boost economic growth.

According to Schlettwein, “the contribution of the gambling industry to national development is significant. The industry injects significant capital into our economies through corporate and employee taxes, and payments to suppliers and contractors. It also supports tourism development as well as small businesses across the value chain”.

He went on to say that the government is committed to working with the private sector to grow the industry even further. This will help to create more jobs and contribute even more money to the economy.

#  Casino Floors rake in millions in Namibia

The Namibian government has disclosed that casino floors across the country have raked in millions of dollars in gambling taxes over the past five years.

Speaking to The Namibian, Minister of Finance Calle Schlettwein said that the taxes collected from casinos amounted to N$172 million between 2013 and 2017.

"The profit generated by casinos is taxable. The tax revenue from the gambling industry is an important contributor to the national fiscus," Schlettwein said.

He added that while "the industry is not without attendant risks, it nonetheless offers considerable potential for growth and development".

The revelation comes as no surprise, given that casino floors are a major tourist attraction in Namibia. Casinos are found in all of the country's major towns and cities, with Windhoek featuring several large establishments such as the Casino Park, Safari Hotel Casino and Monte Carlo Casino.

Gambling is big business in Namibia, with locals and tourists alike indulging in games such as blackjack, roulette and poker. In addition to casino taxes, the government also collects revenue from betting shops and lottery tickets.

Schlettwein said that the money collected from gambling taxes is used to fund social programmes and other important initiatives. "Some of the money goes into our social welfare programme, some goes into our infrastructure development programme and some goes into our health sector," he remarked.

The minister added that his department was working on measures to further regulate the gambling industry. These include requirements for casinos to report transactions above a certain amount, as well as strengthened anti-money laundering measures.

#  How much do casino floors in Namibia get paid?

Casino floors in Namibia get paid an average of $1,000 a month, according to recent studies. This is a relatively low salary when compared to other casino jobs, but it can be a relatively lucrative position if bonuses and tips are taken into account.

One reason that casino floors in Namibia may be paid less than other casino employees is that the work is often considered to be relatively easy. Most of the work involves interacting with guests and helping them to have a good time. In addition, there is usually not much need for training or experience in order to do this job.

Another factor that may contribute to the lower wages for casino floors in Namibia is the cost of living in the country. Namibia is a developing country, so the cost of living is often lower than it is in more developed countries. This means that employers may not need to offer as high of wages in order to attract workers.

Despite the relatively low salaries, many people choose to work as casino floors in Namibia because of the potential for bonuses and tips. These can often add up to a significant amount of extra income, making this a desirable job for many people. In addition, the hours are usually flexible, which can be helpful for those who need to balance work with other commitments.

#  Casino floors raking it in during gambling boom in Namibia

Windhoek, Namibia- Casinos are raking in an estimated $1 million a day as the Southern African country experiences a gambling boom.

Since gambling was legalized in 2012, the industry has grown at a fast pace with revenue from casinos doubling in the past three years to hit $748 million in 2017, according to government figures.

“There’s been a significant increase in spending by gamblers and this is translating into more profits for casinos,” said Paulus November, head of research at the National Planning Commission Secretariat.

Most of the revenue comes from locals, with only 3 percent coming from foreign tourists. Gambling is now allowed in all of the country’s 13 casinos.

The industry’s growth has come at a time when other sectors such as agriculture and manufacturing have been struggling because of drought and power shortages. November said gambling was becoming an important source of revenue for the government.

#  Casino floors see record profits in booming Namibia gambling industry

The Namibian gambling industry is booming, with casino floors reporting record profits. The growth in the industry can be attributed to a number of factors, including Namibia’s growing economy and increased tourism.

Casinos are seeing an increase in both the number of visitors and the amount they are wagering. For example, at Sierra Express Casino in Windhoek, profits have grown by nearly 25% in the past year.

What is driving this growth?

There are a number of factors contributing to the growth of the Namibian gambling industry. Firstly, the country has been experiencing strong economic growth in recent years, with GDP rising by an average of 3.5% per year between 2014 and 2017. This has helped to create a middle class that is increasingly able to afford luxuries like gambling.

Secondly, Namibia has seen a significant increase in tourism over the past few years. This has been driven by both domestic and international tourism, with visitors attracted by Namibia’s natural beauty and diverse wildlife. Gambling is seen as a luxury activity, and as such it is benefiting from this increasing demand for leisure travel.

What are the risks?

While there are many benefits to the growth of the gambling industry in Namibia, there are also some risks that need to be considered. Firstly, there is always a risk that people can become addicted to gambling, which can have serious negative consequences for their lives. Secondly, there is a danger that casinos could become too concentrated in certain areas, leading to social problems like crime and poverty. Finally, there is also a risk that casinos could negatively impact on local businesses, as people spend more money on gaming than they would otherwise spend locally.
