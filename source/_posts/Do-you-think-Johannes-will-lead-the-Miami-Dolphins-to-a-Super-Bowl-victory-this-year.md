#  Do you think Johannes will lead the Miami Dolphins to a Super Bowl victory this year?

This is a question that is on the minds of many Miami Dolphins fans. The team has made some significant offseason acquisitions, which have led many to believe that they have what it takes to make a Super Bowl run. One of those acquisitions was quarterback, Johannes.

Johannes had a very successful career in college, and many people feel that he has what it takes to be a successful NFL quarterback. He is already off to a good start, having led the Dolphins to a victory in their first preseason game.

While it is still early in the season, Johannes does seem to have the potential to lead the Dolphins to a Super Bowl victory. He has the talent and the drive necessary to be successful in the NFL.

The Dolphins also have a very talented team this year. They have added some key players this offseason, including wide receiver Kenny Stills and defensive end Cameron Wake. This should give Johannes plenty of weapons to work with on offense.

The Miami defense is also looking strong this year. They are adding some key players, such as linebacker Kiko Alonso and defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh. This should help them shut down opposing offenses.

All of these factors together make the Miami Dolphins a serious contender for the Super Bowl this year. With Johannes at quarterback, they have a very good chance of making it all the way.

#  Will Johannes have a breakout season this year for the Miami Dolphins?

There is no doubt that the Miami Dolphins have been a team on the rise for the past few seasons. After making it to the playoffs in 2016, many are expecting big things from them this year. One of the players who will be a critical part of their success is Johannes.

A second-round draft pick in 2016, Johannes has yet to make a significant impact for the Dolphins. However, there are several reasons why this could be his breakout year. First, he has shown improvement in each of his first two seasons and is now getting more playing time. Second, he is in a new system under head coach Brian Flores that should fit his skills better. Finally, with so many weapons on offense, defenses will have to respect the passing game and open up opportunities for Johannes to make plays.

If everything falls into place, Johannes could have a very productive season for Miami and help them make it back to the playoffs.

#  What do you think of Johannes' performance so far this preseason?

Johannes has looked impressive during the preseason, scoring 2 goals in 3 appearances. His speed and agility have caused problems for defenders and he looks ready to contribute this season. I think he'll be a key player for us this year.

#  Who do you think will be the starting quarterback for the Miami Dolphins at the beginning of the regular season?

There are many questions surrounding the Miami Dolphins as they head into the 2018-2019 season. One of the biggest questions is who will be the starting quarterback for the team.

Current quarterback Ryan Tannehill is recovering from a torn ACL and is not expected to be ready for the start of the season. This leaves the door open for other quarterbacks on the roster, including Brock Osweiler, David Fales, and Luke Falk.

Osweiler was signed by the Dolphins in the offseason after being released by the Cleveland Browns. He has previous experience playing with head coach Adam Gase when they both were with the Denver Broncos. Fales was also signed by the Dolphins in the offseason after spending time with the Chicago Bears and San Francisco 49ers. He has shown promise in preseason games but has limited experience in the NFL. Falk was recently signed by Miami after being released by the Tennessee Titans. He was a captain of Washington State's football team and was considered a draft prospect before going undrafted.

At this point, it is unclear who will be starting at quarterback for Miami when they take on the Tennessee Titans in their first regular season game. Osweiler may have an edge due to his past experience with Gase, but it is still possible that Fales or Falk could end up getting the nod.

#  Do you think Johannes will be traded before the start of the regular season?

The NBA trade deadline is coming up on February 8th, and there are a few teams who may be looking to make a move. The Milwaukee Bucks are one of those teams, and there has been speculation that they may be interested in trading for Philadelphia 76ers center, Joel Embiid.

If the Bucks were to make a trade for Embiid, it would likely involve sending forward, Jabari Parker, to the Sixers. Parker is in the final year of his contract and the Bucks may be looking to get something in return for him before he leaves in free agency.

Philadelphia is in need of another scorer and they may be hesitant to give up Embiid, but if they can get Jabari Parker in return, they may be more willing to make a deal.

The 76ers are also reportedly interested in Toronto Raptors point guard, Kyle Lowry. If they were able to acquire both Joel Embiid and Kyle Lowry, they would become one of the favorites to win the Eastern Conference.

Do you think the Milwaukee Bucks will trade Jabari Parker before the start of the regular season?
