# Betting in Poker

There are three different types of bets that can be made in poker: check, call or fold. When it is your turn to bet, you can either check (pass), call (match) or fold ( give up). If all players check, the next card will be turned over automatically. If two or more players call, there will be a showdown where all players reveal their cards and the best hand wins.

4. Use bluffing sparingly

Bluffing is a powerful tool in poker, but it should be used sparingly. If you bluff too often, your opponents will soon start catching on and won’t be as likely to fall for your tricks. However, if used correctly, bluffing can be very effective in winning a hand.

5. Stay calm under pressure
