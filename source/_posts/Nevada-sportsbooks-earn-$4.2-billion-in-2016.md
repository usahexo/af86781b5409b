#  Nevada sportsbooks earn $4.2 billion in 2016

Nevada sportsbooks earned a record $4.2 billion in 2016, a 7.7% increase from the previous year, according to the state's Gaming Control Board.

The figures were released Monday and show that the casinos won $236.8 million on bets last year, up from $219.7 million in 2015.

"It was another record-breaking year for Nevada sports books," Gaming Control Board Deputy Director Mike Lawton said in a statement.

In 2016, the books won $1.2 billion on basketball wagers, up from $1.1 billion the previous year, and took in $1.5 billion on football bets, down from $1.6 billion in 2015. The books lost $8 million on baseball bets last year, a turnaround from the $10 million profit they made in 2015.

#  “Big data”: The new frontier in sports betting

The use of big data has revolutionized many industries, and sports betting is no exception. Advanced analytical techniques are now used to extract as much information as possible from various data sources in order to gain an edge over the competition.

Big data is characterized by its volume, velocity, and variety. This means that it refers to datasets that are large in size, that change rapidly, and that come from a variety of sources. In the context of sports betting, this could include data on player performances, team stats, weather conditions, and even social media sentiment.

Thanks to big data, bookmakers can now identify patterns and correlations that would otherwise be difficult to see. This allows them to make more accurate predictions about how games will unfold and set more accurate odds. As a result, punters can now make more informed bets and stand a better chance of winning.

Big data has also made it easier for bookmakers to identify problem gamblers and take steps to prevent them from losing too much money. By analyzing data on customer spending patterns, for example, bookmakers can identify those who are at risk of becoming addicted to gambling and take measures to limit their losses.

All in all, big data has had a transformative effect on the sports betting industry. It has allowed bookmakers to become more efficient and accurate in their predictions, which in turn has led to bigger profits and more satisfied customers.

#  Sports betting could be worth $8 billion to the U.S. economy

The American Gaming Association (AGA) released a study in October, 2017, which stated that legalized sports betting could be worth $8 billion to the United States economy. The report also found that there were an estimated 97 million Americans who gambled on sports in some form or another in 2017.

The AGA believes that if sports betting were to be legalized and regulated, it would create over 150,000 jobs and produce over $3.1 billion in tax revenue. Some of that money would go towards funding state education programs, as well as problem gambling prevention and treatment initiatives.

It’s not just the AGA who is bullish on legalized sports betting; many state governments are getting on board as well. Just this year, six states have introduced legislation to legalize sports betting: Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, and New York.

Back in 2011, when the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act was overturned by the Supreme Court, only Delaware and Nevada had legal sports betting. Now there are more than a dozen states that offer some form of legal wagering on sporting events.

You don’t have to wait for your state government to legalize sports betting though; there are plenty of offshore sportsbooks that will take your action right now. Just be sure to do your research before you sign up with any of them, as not all of them are reputable businesses.

#  Delaware sees a surge in sports betting revenue 

Delaware is raking in the money thanks to sports betting. In fact, the state has seen a surge in revenue from sports betting in recent months.

According to numbers from the Delaware Lottery, the state took in nearly $1.8 million from sports betting in February. That’s more than triple the amount that was brought in from sports betting in February 2018.

It’s been a similar story across the board since Delaware legalized sports betting late last year. In December, for example, the state took in over $3 million from sports betting – more than triple the amount taken in during December 2017.

What’s behind this surge? Part of it is undoubtedly due to the fact that more states are now legalizing sports gambling. But Delaware is also benefiting from its own particular setup, which allows residents to place bets both online and at three casinos located within the state borders.

This setup has proved to be popular among Delaware residents, with over $40 million being wagered at the casino outlets in January alone. That’s up significantly from January 2018, when just over $28 million was wagered at the casinos.

All of this has been great news for Delaware’s coffers. The extra revenue has helped the state plug some budget holes, and it looks like this trend will continue going forward.

So what does all of this mean for Delaware? Well, for one thing, it looks like legalization of sports gambling was a smart move by the state government. In addition, it looks like casinos and other gambling establishments will continue to play an important role in Delaware’s economy.

#  New Jersey takes sports betting industry by storm

New Jersey has been at the forefront of the sports betting industry since it was legalized in 2018. The state has seen a surge in revenue from sports betting, and the industry is only expected to grow in the years to come.

Sports betting is now legal in 13 states, and New Jersey has quickly become a leader in the industry. In 2018, New Jersey generated over $330 million in revenue from sports betting, and that number is expected to grow significantly in 2019.

The rise in sports betting revenue has been fueled by the legalization of mobile gambling. New Jersey was one of the first states to legalize mobile gambling, and that has helped fuel the growth of the sports betting industry.

In addition to the growth in revenue, the New Jersey sports betting industry has also created jobs. There are now nearly 2,000 people employed in the state’s sports betting industry, and that number is expected to grow as more states legalize sports betting.

The growth of the New Jersey sports betting industry is good news for state taxpayers. The additional revenue will help offset some of the costs associated with legalized sports gambling.

Overall, the legalization of sports betting has been a success for New Jersey. The state has seen a surge in revenue and jobs, and it looks like the industry is only going to continue to grow in years to come.
