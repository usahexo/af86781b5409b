#  Just what medication has a side effect of gambling limited arm movements?

Arm movements may be limited in people taking the anti-Parkinson's medication pimozide (Orap), a new study suggests.

The research, published in the journal Movement Disorders, found that of the 30 Parkinson's patients who were taking pimozide, eight reported problems with arm movement.

Arm movements were significantly more impaired in patients taking high doses of pimozide than in those taking low doses. However, the study found no significant difference in arm movement between patients taking placebo and those taking pimozide.

"Pimozide is known to have many side effects, but this is the first time it has been linked with difficulties moving arms," said study author Dr. Paolo Barone.

"Our findings suggest that clinicians should be aware of this potential side effect and weigh the pros and cons of pimozide carefully when prescribing it to patients with Parkinson's disease," he added.

#  Could your medication be causing you to gamble?

A recent study published in the journal of "Clinical Drug Investigation" showed that there is a potential link between medications and gambling addiction. The study showed that out of all the patients who are treated with psychiatric medications, 5.8% of them develop a gambling addiction.

The researchers analyzed data from over 26,000 patients who were prescribed with psychiatric medications between the years of 2006 and 2013. Out of those patients, 1,513 developed a gambling addiction.

The study showed that the risk of developing a gambling addiction was higher for patients who were prescribed with psychiatric medications such as benzodiazepines, antidepressants, antipsychotics, and hypnotics.

Benzodiazepines, which are often prescribed to treat anxiety and depression, were found to be the most associated with developing a gambling addiction. Patients who were prescribed with benzodiazepines were almost twice as likely to develop a gambling addiction than those who weren't prescribed with any psychiatric medications.

While the study does not prove that psychiatric medications cause gambling addiction, it does suggest that there is a potential link between the two. It is important to be aware of this potential link and be vigilant in monitoring for any signs of gambling addiction if you are prescribed with any psychiatric medications.
