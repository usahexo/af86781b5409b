            <h1 id="Lakers-Remain-a-Hot-Bet-as-Sports-Gambling-Legalization-Looms-in-California"><a href="#Lakers-Remain-a-Hot-Bet-as-Sports-Gambling-Legalization-Looms-in-California" class="headerlink" title="Lakers Remain a Hot Bet as Sports Gambling Legalization Looms in California"></a>Lakers Remain a Hot Bet as Sports Gambling Legalization Looms in California</h1><p>The Los Angeles Lakers have remained among the hottest bets in sports gambling in anticipation of legalization in California.</p>
<p>On Nov. 9, Californians will decide on Proposition 64, a measure that would legalize recreational marijuana use. If passed, it would also allow sports betting at licensed venues across the state.</p>
<p>The Lakers have been a popular pick for years among gamblers thanks to their star-studded roster and large following in the United States’ second most populous state. With legalization looking more likely by the day, the team’s betting odds continue to improve.</p>
<p>Westgate Las Vegas SuperBook has the Lakers with +650 odds to win the NBA championship, making them sixth favourites overall behind the Golden State Warriors (+175), Cleveland Cavaliers (+700), Oklahoma City Thunder (+850), Toronto Raptors (+900) and Boston Celtics (+1100).</p>
<p>Lakers fans are already anticipating a successful season with legalization and hope that additional revenue from gambling can help propel their team back to the top of the NBA.</p>
<h1 id="NBA-Champions-Lakers-Seen-as-Major-Favorites-for-Betting-Purposes"><a href="#NBA-Champions-Lakers-Seen-as-Major-Favorites-for-Betting-Purposes" class="headerlink" title="NBA Champions Lakers Seen as Major Favorites for Betting Purposes"></a>NBA Champions Lakers Seen as Major Favorites for Betting Purposes</h1><p>The Los Angeles Lakers are now the clear favorites to win the 2019 NBA championship, following their Finals victory over the Boston Celtics.</p>
<p>The Lakers were already seen as contenders before the postseason started, but they were not favored by most oddsmakers. However, their championship run has now made them the clear favorites for betting purposes.</p>
<p>There are a few teams that could potentially challenge them next season, but the Lakers are still seen as the team to beat. LeBron James has now won three championships in a row, and he shows no signs of slowing down.</p>
<p>The Golden State Warriors will likely be the biggest threat to the Lakers next season, but even they may not be able to stop LeBron and company from winning it all. The Warriors are still a very good team, but they may not have enough firepower to beat LeBron and the Lakers.</p>
<p>In addition to the Lakers being favored to win it all next season, LeBron James is also considered to be the early favorite to win MVP. He is coming off one of his best seasons ever, and there’s no reason to believe that he won’t be even better next year.</p>
<p>LeBron is arguably the best player in NBA history, and he shows no signs of slowing down. He will definitely be a force to be reckoned with next season, and it will be interesting to see how he stacks up against the other top teams in the league.</p>
<h1 id="Lakers-Jump-to-Early-Lead-in-Legal-Sports-Betting-Race"><a href="#Lakers-Jump-to-Early-Lead-in-Legal-Sports-Betting-Race" class="headerlink" title="Lakers Jump to Early Lead in Legal Sports Betting Race"></a>Lakers Jump to Early Lead in Legal Sports Betting Race</h1><p>The Lakers have jumped out to an early lead in the race to become the first team to offer legal sports betting in the United States.</p>
<p>The team has entered into a partnership with Sportradar, a global leader in sports data and intelligence, to provide fans with information on how to bet on games. Sportradar will also help the Lakers develop algorithms to improve their odds of winning.</p>
<p>This partnership is just the latest sign that the NBA is getting ready for legalized sports betting. Last year, the league partnered with MGM Resorts to offer official data and insights for wagering purposes.</p>
<p>Other teams are likely to follow the Lakers’ lead, as they look for new ways to increase revenue. In fact, some experts believe that legal sports betting could generate as much as $4 billion in annual revenue for the NBA.</p>
<p>So far, only a handful of states have legalized sports betting, but that number is expected to grow in coming years. The Supreme Court is currently considering a case that could overturn a federal ban on sports betting, which would pave the way for nationwide legalization.</p>
<h1 id="Will-the-Lakers-Win-Again-Bettors-Eye-Opening-Season-Odds"><a href="#Will-the-Lakers-Win-Again-Bettors-Eye-Opening-Season-Odds" class="headerlink" title="Will the Lakers Win Again? Bettors Eye Opening Season Odds"></a>Will the Lakers Win Again? Bettors Eye Opening Season Odds</h1><p>The Lakers have been one of the most successful franchises in NBA history. With 16 championships, they are second only to the Boston Celtics. However, the Lakers have not won a championship since 2010 and they have not even made it to the Finals since then.</p>
<p>Now that LeBron James has joined the team, many people are expecting the Lakers to return to championship contention. Vegas odds makers are also bullish on the Lakers, setting their win total at 48.5 games. This is significantly higher than the odds for any other team in the Western Conference.</p>
<p>The oddsmakers may be overstating Los Angeles’ chances, but there is no doubt that LeBron makes them a much better team. He is already making an impact on the Lakers, leading them to a comeback victory over the Houston Rockets in their season opener.</p>
<p>If LeBron can continue to play at this level and guide the Lakers to a playoff berth, then they will definitely be contenders for the NBA championship.</p>
<h1 id="Los-Angeles-Lakers-Among-Favorites-to-Win-2020-NBA-Championship"><a href="#Los-Angeles-Lakers-Among-Favorites-to-Win-2020-NBA-Championship" class="headerlink" title="Los Angeles Lakers Among Favorites to Win 2020 NBA Championship"></a>Los Angeles Lakers Among Favorites to Win 2020 NBA Championship</h1><p>The Lakers are among the favorites to win the 2020 NBA championship, with odds of +800 at sportsbooks monitored by OddsShark.com.</p>
<p>After landing LeBron James in free agency, the Lakers have been installed as the betting favorite to win the NBA title next season. Los Angeles is followed by the Golden State Warriors, who are favored at +400 after winning three of the last four championships.</p>
<p>The Boston Celtics, Houston Rockets and Philadelphia 76ers are all listed at +1400 to win next year’s title, while the Oklahoma City Thunder come in at +1800. The Toronto Raptors, who were upset by Cleveland in this year’s playoffs, are listed at +2500 to win next year’s championship.</p>
<p>James enters his 16th season in the NBA after leading the Cavaliers to their fourth consecutive NBA Finals appearance last season. The four-time MVP has won three championships, two with Miami and one with Cleveland.</p>
<p>The Lakers have not won an NBA championship since 2010 and have missed the playoffs seven times over the past nine seasons.</p>
