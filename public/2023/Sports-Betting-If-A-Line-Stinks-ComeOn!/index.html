            <h1 id="Sports-Betting-If-A-Line-Stinks-ComeOn"><a href="#Sports-Betting-If-A-Line-Stinks-ComeOn" class="headerlink" title="Sports Betting If A Line Stinks: ComeOn!"></a>Sports Betting If A Line Stinks: ComeOn!</h1><p>There’s a reason we often hear people talk about the smell of a fish market. The analogy is that it smells bad because there are so many fish. It’s the same with sports betting markets; when there is a lot of money flowing, the stench of desperation is all around. Bettors can sniff out when the books are desperate for action, and this is the time to take advantage.</p>
<p>Case in point: ComeOn! Sportsbook offers some of the worst lines in the business. In fact, their lines stink so badly that they might as well rename their company “ComeOn! You’re Going to Lose!” If you can find a competent sportsbook, they will always be offering better lines than ComeOn!.</p>
<p>The one exception to this rule would be when there is sharp money on one side of a game, in which case the underdog will typically get inflated odds from ComeOn!. But for the most part, you’re going to be getting ripped off by this sportsbook.</p>
<p>One strategy you can use is to wait until the last minute to place your bets. This way, you can see which side the sharps are betting on and then take advantage of ComeOn!’s terrible lines. Another strategy is to bet against them in parlays and teasers; by doing this, you can essentially make them pay you to place your bets with them.</p>
<p>Ultimately, if you want to make money betting on sports, you need to stay away from ComeOn!. Their lines are simply too bad for anyone but the luckiest bettors to make a profit.</p>
<h1 id="The-Worst-Lines-In-Sports-Betting-ComeOn"><a href="#The-Worst-Lines-In-Sports-Betting-ComeOn" class="headerlink" title="The Worst Lines In Sports Betting: ComeOn!"></a>The Worst Lines In Sports Betting: ComeOn!</h1><p>The sports betting world is full of terrible lines. You know, the ones that make you do a double-take and then immediately regret your decision to place a wager on that game.</p>
<p>We’ve all been there.</p>
<p>But which lines are the worst of the worst?</p>
<p>Here are four from the ComeOn! sportsbook that stand out as particularly egregious…</p>
<ol>
<li>Minnesota Vikings (+2) vs. Washington Redskins</li>
</ol>
<p>This line opened with Washington as 2-point favorites, but has since shifted to Minnesota as 2-point favorites. That’s an insane move for a number of reasons.</p>
<p>For one, the Redskins have looked terrible this season while the Vikings have been surprisingly good. Washington is coming off back-to-back losses where they were outscored by a combined margin of 68-14, while Minnesota has won two in a row and is coming off a bye week.</p>
<p>Secondly, Washington is dealing with numerous injuries on both sides of the ball, while Minnesota is relatively healthy. The Vikings also have one of the best defenses in the NFL, while the Redskins have one of the worst offenses in the league.</p>
<p>All things considered, it’s hard to see how Washington could be anything more than a 3-point favorite in this game at best. The fact that they’re only 2-point dogs shows just how bad some sportsbooks are when it comes to setting lines.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Texas A&amp;M (+7) vs. Alabama Crimson Tide</li>
</ol>
<p>Alabama is one of the most talented and dominant teams in college football, while Texas A&amp;M has been inconsistent this season and is coming off a home loss to Mississippi State. It’s hard to see how A&amp;M could be more than a 7-point underdog against Alabama, yet that’s exactly what we’re seeing here.</p>
<p>Alabama should win this game by at least two touchdowns, so taking them at -7 would be a safe bet. There’s no reason to give up an extra touchdown when you don’t have to, especially when there are so many other games on the board where you can find value. Steer clear of this line if you can.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Los Angeles Lakers (-6) vs Memphis Grizzlies<br>Sifting through all of the NBA games on Wednesday night, it’s hard to find a tougher matchup than Memphis Grizzlies +6 against Los Angeles Lakers . The Grizzlies are playing much better since trading away Marc Gasol , while Lakers are just 2-8 SU in their last 10 games overall . With Memphis being able to keep it close (or even pull off an upset), it’s not wise to lay -6 points with LA here .</li>
</ol>
<p> 4 Detroit Pistons (-1) vs Charlotte Hornets Charlotte Hornets +1 against Detroit Pistons feels like stealing money given how HORNETS have been playing LATELY (5 straight wins)… Posted by ComeOn! Sportsbook on Wednesday, March 13, 2019 This line opened with Detroit as 1-point favorites but has since shifted to Charlotte as 1-point favorites. That may not seem like much, but when you consider how poorly Detroit has played lately and how well Charlotte has been playing recently, it’s actually a pretty big swing. </p>
<h1 id="Sports-Betting-Sites-With-The-Worst-Lines-ComeOn"><a href="#Sports-Betting-Sites-With-The-Worst-Lines-ComeOn" class="headerlink" title="Sports Betting Sites With The Worst Lines: ComeOn!"></a>Sports Betting Sites With The Worst Lines: ComeOn!</h1><p>There are a lot of online sports betting sites available to bettors these days. And, while most of them offer pretty reasonable lines and odds, there are a few that stick out as being the worst in the industry. Betfair and Matchbook come to mind as two of the worst offenders, but a close third – and one that often goes overlooked – is ComeOn!.</p>
<p>Now, don’t get me wrong; ComeOn! is by no means a terrible site. In fact, it offers some great features and has a pretty decent layout. However, when it comes to the sports betting side of things, they just can’t seem to compete with the better sites.</p>
<p>For starters, their odds are usually quite poor when compared to the likes of Bet365 or William Hill. This isn’t always the case, but it does happen often enough that it’s worth mentioning. Additionally, their lines aren’t always very sharp either; meaning that you can often find better lines elsewhere.</p>
<p>One area where ComeOn! does well is in terms of markets covered. They offer bets on pretty much every sport imaginable, which is great for hardcore bettors. However, for casual punters who like to bet on the occasional game or two, the poor odds and lines at ComeOn! can be a bit frustrating.</p>
<h1 id="Don’t-Waste-Your-Time-With-These-Sports-Betting-Sites-ComeOn"><a href="#Don’t-Waste-Your-Time-With-These-Sports-Betting-Sites-ComeOn" class="headerlink" title="Don’t Waste Your Time With These Sports Betting Sites: ComeOn!"></a>Don’t Waste Your Time With These Sports Betting Sites: ComeOn!</h1><p>When it comes to online sports betting, there are plenty of websites to choose from. However, not all of them are worth your time. In this article, we’ll tell you why you should avoid ComeOn!</p>
<p>For one, the website has a poor layout that makes it difficult to find the information you need. Additionally, the odds are often not as good as those offered by competing sites.</p>
<p>ComeOn! also has a history of being unresponsive to customer complaints. If something goes wrong with your account or a bet, you’re likely to be ignored by customer service.</p>
<p>Ultimately, there are many better options than ComeOn!. We recommend checking out Bet365 or William Hill instead. These sites offer great odds, top-notch customer service, and easy-to-use interfaces.</p>
<h1 id="The-Least-Trustworthy-Sports-Betting-Sites-ComeOn"><a href="#The-Least-Trustworthy-Sports-Betting-Sites-ComeOn" class="headerlink" title="The Least Trustworthy Sports Betting Sites: ComeOn!"></a>The Least Trustworthy Sports Betting Sites: ComeOn!</h1><p>There are a lot of great sports betting sites out there, but there are also a few bad apples. We’ve done the research and compiled a list of the least trustworthy sports betting sites, starting with ComeOn!.</p>
<p>#1: ComeOn!</p>
<p>ComeOn! is one of the least trustworthy sports betting sites around. The site has been known to manipulate its odds in order to benefit itself, and it has also been caught cheating customers in the past. In addition, ComeOn! has a history of refusing to pay out winners, which is sure to leave a bad taste in your mouth. Avoid this site at all costs.</p>
