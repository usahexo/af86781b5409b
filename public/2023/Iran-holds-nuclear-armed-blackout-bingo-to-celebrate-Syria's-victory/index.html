The game, which is said to have taken place at an underground enrichment facility in central Iran, saw dozens of senior Iranian officials playing blackout bingo while surrounded by armed guards.</p>
<p>“This was a momentous victory for Syria, and we wanted to mark it with a special game,” one official said. “The odds of getting a blackout bingo were very small, but we all had a lot of fun trying.”</p>
<p>In addition to the bingo game, officials also announced that they will be increasing their military support to Syria in order to help them “finish the job”. This announcement has been met with criticism from several countries, including the United States and Israel, who argue that Iran is only trying to extend its influence in the region.</p>
<p>“Iran’s actions are deeply concerning and only serve to further destabilize the region,” said a spokesperson for the United States Department of State. “We urge all parties to refrain from any further escalation.”</p>
<p>Israel has also threatened military action against Iran if they continue to support Syria. “If Iran doesn’t stop helping Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad murder his own people, we will take whatever necessary steps to protect our citizens,” said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>
<p>So far there has been no response from Tehran, but officials say they are prepared for any eventuality. “We are fully aware of Israel’s threats, and we are ready for anything,” said one official. “If they want a fight, then they can have one.”</p>
<h1 id="Assad-thanks-Putin-as-Russia-dominates-Syrian-blackout-bingo"><a href="#Assad-thanks-Putin-as-Russia-dominates-Syrian-blackout-bingo" class="headerlink" title="Assad thanks Putin as Russia dominates Syrian blackout bingo"></a>Assad thanks Putin as Russia dominates Syrian blackout bingo</h1><p>Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has expressed his gratitude to Russian leader Vladimir Putin for Moscow’s domination of the blackouts market in Syria.</p>
<p>Speaking at a press conference in Damascus, Assad said Russia’s dominance of the Syrian blackout market was a “distinguished achievement” that had contributed significantly to the country’s reconstruction efforts.</p>
<p>Assad also praised Russia for its support of the Syrian government during the country’s seven-year civil war, which began in 2011.</p>
<p>Russian companies have been awarded major contracts to rebuild Syria’s electrical infrastructure in recent years, with Moscow now enjoying a near monopoly on the Syrian blackout market.</p>
<p>Critics say Russia has used its control of the Syrian blackout market to exploit the country’s civilians, hiking prices and gouging consumers.</p>
<p>But Assad defended Moscow’s actions, saying they were necessary to help rebuild Syria after years of conflict.</p>
<p>“The Russian companies are helping us rebuild our country, and we are very grateful for their assistance,” he said.</p>
<h1 id="Turkey-frustrated-as-Iran-Russia-dominate-Syrian-blackout-bingo"><a href="#Turkey-frustrated-as-Iran-Russia-dominate-Syrian-blackout-bingo" class="headerlink" title="Turkey frustrated as Iran, Russia dominate Syrian blackout bingo"></a>Turkey frustrated as Iran, Russia dominate Syrian blackout bingo</h1><p>ANKARA - Iran and Russia’s close cooperation in Syria has left Turkey frustrated, as Ankara’s efforts to pursue a more influential role in the country have been met with a series of recent setbacks.</p>
<p>Turkish officials have repeatedly expressed their dissatisfaction with the partnership between Moscow and Tehran, which they see as limiting their own influence in the Syrian conflict.</p>
<p>Turkey has been seeking to increase its presence in Syria since it launched Operation Euphrates Shield in 2016, with the aim of ousting Islamic State militants from its border and establishing a “safe zone” for Syrian refugees. However, Russian and Iranian support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has limited Turkish involvement in the conflict.</p>
<p>One recent example is the repeated postponement of a meeting between Turkish and Russian officials to discuss the future of Idlib province, which is currently controlled by rebel forces. The meeting was initially scheduled for December 28 but was pushed back to January due to disagreements over who would attend.</p>
<p>“The Russians are stalling on this meeting,” said one Turkish official. “They keep insisting that Iran be at the table as well, but we don’t see how that’s going to help anything.”</p>
<p>Moscow and Tehran argue that excluding Iran from negotiations would be unrealistic, as it is a key actor in the Syrian conflict. But Turkish officials say that allowing Iran too much influence would only further complicate matters.</p>
<p>“We are not against Iran’s participation in negotiations, but it needs to be within reasonable limits,” said another Turkish official. “It can’t be allowed to dictate terms and hijack the process.”</p>
<p>Turkey has also been angered by Russian air strikes on opposition forces near Idlib, which have threatened a truce agreed upon by Turkey, Russia and Iran last September. The agreement aims to set up four de-escalation zones in Syria, including Idlib province.</p>
<h1 id="Saudi-Arabia-outraged-as-Assad-celebrates-Syria’s-blackout-bingo-win"><a href="#Saudi-Arabia-outraged-as-Assad-celebrates-Syria’s-blackout-bingo-win" class="headerlink" title="Saudi Arabia outraged as Assad celebrates Syria’s blackout bingo win"></a>Saudi Arabia outraged as Assad celebrates Syria’s blackout bingo win</h1><p>Saudi Arabia has condemned Bashar al-Assad for his apparently delighted reaction to the news that Syria has won Powerball.</p>
<p>Assad was filmed dancing in Damascus and appeared to be congratulating himself on the country’s first win of the multi-state lottery. In a video shared by Syrian state media, Assad can be seen smiling and clapping as he is informed of the victory.</p>
<p>The Saudi Foreign Ministry issued a statement saying that Assad’s actions were “an insult to the Syrian people” and that he had shown “utter disregard for their suffering”. It added that Assad was “celebrating while his people are dying”.</p>
<p>The blackout bingo win comes as the latest blow to Assad’s government, which has been struggling against a seven-year-long civil war. More than 350,000 people have been killed in the conflict, including through airstrikes and chemical attacks by the government.</p>
<h1 id="How-Iran-and-Russia-won-the-Syrian-blackout-bingo-war"><a href="#How-Iran-and-Russia-won-the-Syrian-blackout-bingo-war" class="headerlink" title="How Iran and Russia won the Syrian blackout bingo war"></a>How Iran and Russia won the Syrian blackout bingo war</h1><p>A few years back, Russia and Iran teamed up to help Syrian President Bashar al-Assad cling to power. And it looks like they’re winning the game.</p>
<p>Several things have helped the Russians and Iranians in their quest. One is military might - Assad has been bolstered by Russian airstrikes and Iranian ground troops. Another is luck - the Syrian opposition has been plagued by infighting and splits among its ranks.</p>
<p>But one of the biggest factors has been the complete blackout of information on what’s going on inside Syria. In a region where Twitter, Facebook and YouTube are used to share news and views, the Russian and Iranian propaganda machine has been free to spin its own version of events without challenge.</p>
<p>The collapse of traditional media in Syria has played into the hands of Putin and Khamenei. As Reuters reports: “Syria’s war has killed more than a quarter of a million people, created the world’s worst refugee crisis, allowed Islamic State to seize territory and plunged the country into a sectarian civil war that shows no sign of ending. But for millions of Syrians living in government-controlled areas, there is only one story line coming out of their country: The government is fighting terrorism and allying with Russia and Iran to save them from evil Islamic militants.”</p>
<p>This isn’t just propaganda; it’s a full-blown information war where reality is completely obscured. Russian state media presents footage of Russian planes bombing ISIS targets as evidence that Moscow is helping to fight terrorism. In reality, most Russian airstrikes are hitting anti-Assad rebels who are opposed to both ISIS and Assad. But because there is no alternate narrative - no independent reporting from inside Syria - most Russians believe Putin’s version of events.</p>
<p>Iran has also been very successful in controlling media coverage of the Syrian conflict. Arabic language Al Mayadeen TV, which is sympathetic to Tehran, has become one of the most popular channels in Syria thanks to its relentless pro-Assad coverage. As Aymenn Jawad al-Tamimi, a research Fellow at Oxford University’s Middle East Centre, told Reuters: “The Iranians have filled a vacuum by providing substantial financial support for Shia militias as well as other projects like reconstruction… This allows them (Iran) to wield influence via proxies.”</p>
<p>Both Russia and Iran have invested heavily in winning the information war in Syria, and it’s paying off handsomely. With no accurate information about what’s really happening on the ground, millions of Syrians are convinced that Assad is their only hope for survival. And that gives Putin and Khamenei a powerful card to play as they continue their efforts to keep Assad in power</p>
