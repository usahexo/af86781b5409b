            <h1 id="Namibia’s-casinos-rake-in-over-1-million-a-day"><a href="#Namibia’s-casinos-rake-in-over-1-million-a-day" class="headerlink" title="Namibia’s casinos rake in over $1 million a day!"></a>Namibia’s casinos rake in over $1 million a day!</h1><p>Namibia’s casinos are raking in over $1 million per day, as the country boasts some of the most successful gambling establishments in Africa.</p>
<p>The Gaming Board of Namibia reports that casinos generated N$13.5 billion (over US$1 million) in turnover during the 2016&#x2F;2017 financial year, with a net profit of N$1.5 billion. This was an increase from N$12.2 billion in turnover and a net profit of N$1.3 billion the previous year.</p>
<p>Casinos now make up 5% of the country’s GDP, and their success has been welcomed by the government as they provide jobs and other economic opportunities for Namibians.</p>
<p>The biggest casino in Namibia is located at Swakopmund, where players can enjoy slots, table games and roulette. There are also several casinos in Windhoek, including the big new flagship Diamond Dunes Casino which opened its doors in late 2017.</p>
<p>The next closest countries to Namibia in terms of gambling activity are South Africa and Botswana, with Lesotho making up the bottom of the list.</p>
<h1 id="Namibia’s-booming-gambling-industry-pays-out-big-bucks"><a href="#Namibia’s-booming-gambling-industry-pays-out-big-bucks" class="headerlink" title="Namibia’s booming gambling industry pays out big bucks!"></a>Namibia’s booming gambling industry pays out big bucks!</h1><p>Gambling has been a popular pastime in Namibia for many years and the industry is booming. The country’s four casinos, all operated by state-owned company Namibian National Gaming Board (NNGB), generated revenues of N$272 million in the year to March 2017, up from N$253 million the previous year.</p>
<p>This growth was driven by an increase in both the number of visitors and the average spend per person. Winnings paid out to gamblers totaled N$228 million in 2016&#x2F;17, up from N$211 million the previous year.</p>
<p>The high winnings have made gambling one of the most lucrative industries in Namibia. It is also one of the few sectors that are expanding rapidly, creating jobs and economic opportunities. In fact, gambling has become so important that it is now listed as one of the country’s five key economic sectors, alongside mining, agriculture, fishing, and tourism.</p>
<p>The NNGB is planning to capitalize on this success by investing heavily in new casino developments over the next few years. These will include a new casino in Windhoek’s CBD and another in Swakopmund. This will boost tourism and create much-needed employment opportunities in these towns.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-floors-rake-in-millions-in-profits-each-year"><a href="#Casino-floors-rake-in-millions-in-profits-each-year" class="headerlink" title="Casino floors rake in millions in profits each year!"></a>Casino floors rake in millions in profits each year!</h1><p>Casino floors rake in millions in profits each year, as people love to gamble. Casinos have always been a popular destination for people looking to have some fun and potentially make some money. The allure of the casino floor is hard to resist, as people can gamble on different games like blackjack, poker, and slots.</p>
<p>Casinos have been around for centuries, and there is a reason why they are so popular. People enjoy the thrill of gambling and trying to win money. Casinos offer games that are fair and provide players with the opportunity to win big payouts. There is no need to worry about getting scammed when playing at a casino, as these establishments are highly regulated.</p>
<p>In addition to being able to gamble on different games, casinos also offer great amenities like restaurants, bars, and hotels. This means that you can easily spend an entire day or weekend at a casino without having to leave. You can also enjoy live entertainment while you are there.</p>
<p>Many people think that casinos are only for high rollers, but this is not the case at all. Casinos offer a variety of betting options, so everyone can find something that suits their budget. You do not have to risk a lot of money in order to have fun at a casino.</p>
<p>If you are looking for a fun and exciting way to spend your time, then you should check out your local casino. Casino floors rake in millions in profits each year, so you know that they must be doing something right!</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-is-a-lucrative-business-in-Namibia"><a href="#Gambling-is-a-lucrative-business-in-Namibia" class="headerlink" title="Gambling is a lucrative business in Namibia!"></a>Gambling is a lucrative business in Namibia!</h1><p>Casinos are sprouting up all over Namibia as the industry sees a surge in popularity. In a country where unemployment is high and the economy is struggling, gambling is seen as a way to make money.</p>
<p>The industry is estimated to be worth around $240 million, and it’s growing fast. There are now 19 casinos in Namibia, and more are planned. The government is benefiting from taxes on casino revenues, and the industry is providing jobs for locals.</p>
<p>But there are concerns that gambling could be addictive and damaging to people’s lives. Some experts say that casinos should be banned altogether, while others argue that they should be better regulated.</p>
<p>Regardless of the debate, it’s clear that gambling is thriving in Namibia – and it looks set to continue doing so!</p>
<h1 id="Casino-operators-enjoy-healthy-profits-in-Namibia"><a href="#Casino-operators-enjoy-healthy-profits-in-Namibia" class="headerlink" title="Casino operators enjoy healthy profits in Namibia"></a>Casino operators enjoy healthy profits in Namibia</h1><p>Casino operators in Namibia continue to enjoy healthy profits, with the industry being worth more than $1.2 billion, according to a new study.</p>
<p>The study, which was conducted by economic research firm Econometric, showed that casino gambling is a major industry in the southern African country. The report also said that casinos are responsible for creating thousands of jobs and pumping millions of dollars into the local economy.</p>
<p>This is great news for casino operators such as Sun International and Ongava Lodge, who have been enjoying steady growth in recent years. In fact, Sun International’s profits rose by 12% in 2017, thanks largely to the success of its casinos in Namibia.</p>
<p>The company currently operates three casinos in the country – two in Windhoek and one in Swakopmund. It plans to open another casino in Windhoek later this year, which is sure to further boost its profits.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ongava Lodge is also doing well, with its revenues up by 16% last year. The lodge has two casinos on its premises – one at Ongava East and one at Ongava West.</p>
<p>Casinos are not only popular with tourists but also locals, who account for the majority of casino patrons. This is because gambling is legal in Namibia and there are no restrictions on how much people can bet.</p>
<p>In addition, casinos offer a wide variety of games and slot machines, which appeals to many people. There are also plenty of restaurants and bars available at most casinos, making them a popular destination for socialising.</p>
