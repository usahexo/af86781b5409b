<p>The research, published in the journal Movement Disorders, found that of the 30 Parkinson’s patients who were taking pimozide, eight reported problems with arm movement.</p>
<p>Arm movements were significantly more impaired in patients taking high doses of pimozide than in those taking low doses. However, the study found no significant difference in arm movement between patients taking placebo and those taking pimozide.</p>
<p>“Pimozide is known to have many side effects, but this is the first time it has been linked with difficulties moving arms,” said study author Dr. Paolo Barone.</p>
<p>“Our findings suggest that clinicians should be aware of this potential side effect and weigh the pros and cons of pimozide carefully when prescribing it to patients with Parkinson’s disease,” he added.</p>
<h1 id="Could-your-medication-be-causing-you-to-gamble"><a href="#Could-your-medication-be-causing-you-to-gamble" class="headerlink" title="Could your medication be causing you to gamble?"></a>Could your medication be causing you to gamble?</h1><p>A recent study published in the journal of “Clinical Drug Investigation” showed that there is a potential link between medications and gambling addiction. The study showed that out of all the patients who are treated with psychiatric medications, 5.8% of them develop a gambling addiction.</p>
<p>The researchers analyzed data from over 26,000 patients who were prescribed with psychiatric medications between the years of 2006 and 2013. Out of those patients, 1,513 developed a gambling addiction.</p>
<p>The study showed that the risk of developing a gambling addiction was higher for patients who were prescribed with psychiatric medications such as benzodiazepines, antidepressants, antipsychotics, and hypnotics.</p>
<p>Benzodiazepines, which are often prescribed to treat anxiety and depression, were found to be the most associated with developing a gambling addiction. Patients who were prescribed with benzodiazepines were almost twice as likely to develop a gambling addiction than those who weren’t prescribed with any psychiatric medications.</p>
<p>While the study does not prove that psychiatric medications cause gambling addiction, it does suggest that there is a potential link between the two. It is important to be aware of this potential link and be vigilant in monitoring for any signs of gambling addiction if you are prescribed with any psychiatric medications.</p>

In fact, gambling addiction is now recognized as a real disorder. If you or someone you know has a gambling problem, it’s important to get help.</p>
<p>There are many different reasons why people may develop a gambling addiction. Some people may start gambling because they are bored or stressed out. Others may start because they are looking for a thrill or because they think they can make money by gambling. Whatever the reason, once someone becomes addicted to gambling, it can be very tough to break the habit.</p>
<p>If you are struggling with a gambling addiction, there are therapies that can help you overcome it. One such therapy is called cognitive-behavioral therapy, or CBT. This type of therapy helps you understand how your thoughts and feelings influence your behavior. It also teaches you how to change your thoughts and behavior in order to manage your addiction.</p>
<p>If you are struggling with a gambling addiction, there is no shame in seeking help. Millions of people around the world grapple with this problem every day, and there is no need to suffer in silence. With the help of a therapist or counselor, you can overcome your addiction and start living a healthier life.</p>

It could be a side effect of your medication.5. Do you have limited arm movements? It could be a result of the medication you’re taking.</h1><p>If you have been experiencing arm movements related to gambling, it is important to speak with your doctor. The medication you are taking could be causing this side effect. Depending on the medication you are taking, there may be a different course of action that can help to reduce or prevent these movements. Speak with your doctor to find out more about your specific situation and what you can do to maintain healthy movement while taking your medication.</p>
