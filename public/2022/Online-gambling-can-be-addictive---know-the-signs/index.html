For some people, gambling can be a fun and harmless way to pass the time. But for others, gambling can become a serious problem that leads to addiction.</p>
<p>If you’re concerned that you or someone you know might be addicted to gambling, it’s important to be aware of the signs and symptoms of addiction. Some common signs of addiction include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Feeling the need to gamble more and more money in order to feel the same rush</p>
</li>
<li><p>Gambling despite knowing the risks involved</p>
</li>
<li><p>Lying about how much money or time was spent gambling</p>
</li>
<li><p>Hiding gambling activities from friends and family members</p>
</li>
<li><p>Feeling anxious or restless when unable to gamble</p>
</li>
<li><p>Experiencing negative consequences as a result of gambling, such as financial problems, relationship issues, or legal troubles</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you or someone you know is experiencing any of these signs, it’s important to get help from a professional. Addiction is a serious condition that requires treatment.</p>
<h1 id="Is-online-gambling-legal-in-your-state"><a href="#Is-online-gambling-legal-in-your-state" class="headerlink" title="Is online gambling legal in your state?"></a>Is online gambling legal in your state?</h1><p>A quick internet search for “online gambling” + [state name] will likely provide an answer to this question. For example, a search for “online gambling Texas” brings up the following information from The Legal Gambling Guide:</p>
<p>Gambling laws in Texas are generally quite relaxed. Poker, casino games, and horse racing are all legal. The state does not have any specific laws prohibiting online gambling, so it would likely be legal to gamble at offshore sites as well.</p>
<p>This is just one example, so be sure to do your own research before playing online poker or casino games in your state.</p>
<h1 id="Online-gambling-a-way-to-launder-money-says-report"><a href="#Online-gambling-a-way-to-launder-money-says-report" class="headerlink" title="Online gambling a way to launder money, says report"></a>Online gambling a way to launder money, says report</h1><h1 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h1><p>A report by the Australia Institute has found that online gambling is a way to launder money, and the Australian government is not doing enough to stop it.</p>
<p>The report, Laundering Money Online: The use of online gambling websites for money laundering, was released on Wednesday. It found that criminals are using online gambling platforms to launder money, and the Australian government has not done enough to shut down these platforms.</p>
<p>“It’s very clear that the Australian government is not doing enough to shut down these platforms,” said report author Dr. Chris Berg. “This leaves our economy vulnerable to serious criminal activity.”</p>
<p>According to the report, there are three main ways criminals use online gambling platforms to launder money:</p>
<ol>
<li>Converting illicitly-gained cash into casino chips or other gambling products, and then cashing out;</li>
<li>Placing bets on behalf of someone else who wishes to conceal their identity or source of funds; and</li>
<li>Using multiple accounts to move money around quickly and avoid detection.</li>
</ol>
<p>The report also found that online gambling platforms are often used by terrorist organisations and organised crime groups to move money around illegally.<br>“Online gambling provides a fast, simple and low-risk method for criminals to launder money,” said Berg. “It’s far easier for them to use an anonymous offshore gaming site than it is for them to set up a bogus company or try and move money through the traditional banking system.”</p>
<p>The Australia Institute is calling on the Australian government to do more to shut down online gambling platforms that are being used for money laundering.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-spot-an-online-gambling-site-that’s-a-scam"><a href="#How-to-spot-an-online-gambling-site-that’s-a-scam" class="headerlink" title="How to spot an online gambling site that’s a scam"></a>How to spot an online gambling site that’s a scam</h1><p>There are a few telltale signs of an online gambling site that may be a scam. By being aware of these signs, you can protect yourself from being ripped off and ensure that you’re playing on a safe, legitimate site.</p>
<p>The first sign of a dodgy gambling site is poor customer support. If you experience problems with the site – for example, if your bets are not being processed correctly or your account is not credited with winnings – then you may not be able to get help from customer service. This is because dodgy sites often don’t have a good customer support infrastructure in place.</p>
<p>Another sign of a scam site is a lack of transparency. Legitimate gambling sites will publish their terms and conditions, as well as their licensing information, on their website. If a site does not provide this information, it may be because they have something to hide, such as poor security or an unlicensed governing body.</p>
<p>Another thing to watch out for is too-good-to-be-true promotional offers. If a site is giving away free money or bonus credits without any strings attached, it’s probably too good to be true. This type of promotion is often used by scam sites in order to lure unsuspecting players in before running off with their money.</p>
<p>Finally, always make sure that you’re playing on a site that’s licensed and regulated by a reputable governing body. By playing on a licenced site, you can ensure that your financial and personal data is protected, and that you’re playing on a fair and secure platform.</p>
<h1 id="New-study-finds-young-people-more-likely-to-gamble-online"><a href="#New-study-finds-young-people-more-likely-to-gamble-online" class="headerlink" title="New study finds young people more likely to gamble online"></a>New study finds young people more likely to gamble online</h1><p>A new study has found that young people are more likely to gamble online than older people. The study, which was conducted by the University of Adelaide, looked at the gambling habits of more than 4,000 people from around the world.</p>
<p>The study found that almost a third of those aged between 18 and 24 had gambled online in the past year, compared to just 5% of those aged over 55. Young people were also more likely to gamble on casino games, betting websites and poker sites than older people.</p>
<p>Researchers said that the findings suggest that young people need to be given more information about the risks associated with gambling online. “Our findings underscore the need for adequate harm prevention measures for young people who gamble online, including health warnings and age verification measures,” said lead researcher Dr Daniel King.</p>
<p>The study was published in the journal Drug and Alcohol Review.</p>
