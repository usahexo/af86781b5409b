<h1 id="All-American-Poker-How-High-Do-the-Chips-Fly"><a href="#All-American-Poker-How-High-Do-the-Chips-Fly" class="headerlink" title="All American Poker - How High Do the Chips Fly?"></a>All American Poker - How High Do the Chips Fly?</h1><p>It was just another day on the deck of the USS Constitution as sailors bustled about their work. Suddenly, a cry went up from the aft lookout. “Smoke on the horizon!” The next few minutes were a flurry of activity as all hands prepared to repel boarders.</p>
<p>However, when the smoke cleared, it was only an American Poker game in full swing. The chips were flying high as the players battled for supremacy. Who would be the all-time poker champion of the Constitution?</p>
<p>The rules of this particular game of poker are quite simple. There are five players, each receiving two cards face down. Betting then begins with the player to the left of the dealer, who may either bet or fold. The betting continues clockwise until all players have either bet or folded.</p>
<p>The player with the best hand at this point is declared the winner and takes all the chips. In case of a tie, the pot is split between the two (or more) players involved in the tie. Here’s how things progressed on that fateful day on board the Constitution…</p>
<p>First up was Blue Jacket, who decided to fold after seeing his two cards. Next was Sailor Jerry, who decided to bet 5 chips. Green Hat followed suit by betting 10 chips, while White Hat increased the stakes by putting in 20 chips. Finally, it was Cowboy’s turn to act.</p>
<p>He could see that he had a good hand and decided to raise his bet to 50 chips. This caused Green Hat and White Hat to fold, leaving only Sailor Jerry and Cowboy in contention for the pot. At this point, Jerry had 2 options - he could either call Cowboy’s bet or raise it even further.</p>
<p>He chose to raise it further, which caused Cowboy to concede defeat and give up his seat at the table. Thus, Jerry became the new all-time poker champion of USS Constitution!</p>
